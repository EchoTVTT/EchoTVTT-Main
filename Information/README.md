- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EchoTVTT I'm a current business owner of Quantum Dot Games, LLC, and a U.S. Army Veteran!


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-    I also have recently changed my name to @EchoTV_TT. This is part of a persona change I've wanted to do for some time, and has taken a lot of thought to finally
-    settle into a name that I really like.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 
-    Iâ€™m interested in gaming, coding, and writing. I'm a big fan of traveling, and I love spending time with my family and my two German Shepherds. I'm a novice when 
-    it comes to programming and developing working games, but, with time, I hope to become an indie developer that has at least been honest with myself, and 
-    really just make something that makes me happy -- whatever that may end up being.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-    Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and C#. I'm also dabbling in Python, and HTML.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-    Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help be become a better programmer and developer.

-    This is my first ever video game application that I've made. And likely by the time thi reaches another person -- I will have a better grasp on
-    how to program and develop working titles.

- A bit about me personally: 

- I served in the United States Military from 2018-2019. I was honorably discharged for fairly long list of medical issues that I deal with to this day. Some of the things that drew 
  me to coding and developing video games is my deep incredible passion for video games, and importantly how they make people, and myself included feel while they're playing.

- I do have a Discord server that you are welcome to join my server at this link<https://discord.gg/H9duzJdJSJ>
